## [R. Peyton Cline](mailto:robert.cline@colorado.edu)
Peyton was a graduate student in the Eaves group starting in 2015. He was awarded his Ph.D. in Chemical Physics in 2020 and then stuck around as a postdoc until 2022. He moved on to a position at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). A list of his work during his time at the Eaves group can be found on [his page](https://www.colorado.edu/lab/eavesgroup/r-peyton-cline) on the Eaves group webpage. A large portion of the information about VASP in this Manual originated from a master class he taught in 2022 before he left for NREL.

## [Sina G. Lewis](mailto:sina.lewis@colorado.edu)
Sina is a current graduate student in the Eaves group---and also the primary author of this document, hi there! I joined the group in 2019 after receiving my B.S. in Physics at `The' Ohio State University. Information about my work can be found on [my page](https://www.colorado.edu/lab/eavesgroup/sina-g-lewis) on the Eaves group webpage.

## [Kori E. Smyser](mailto:kori.smyser@colorado.edu)
Kori was a graduate student in the Eaves group. She joined the group in 2017 and was awarded her Ph.D. in Chemical Physics in 2022. After graduating she joined Sandeep Sharma for a postdoc. Much of the information about Julia in this Manual is from a master class she taught in 2020 when Joel first wanted everyone to learn the language. A list of her work during her time in the Eaves group can be found on [her page](https://www.colorado.edu/lab/eavesgroup/kori-e-smyser) on the Eaves group webpage. 

## [Alexander J. Staat](mailto:alex.staat@colorado.edu)
Alex is a current graduate student in the Eaves group. He joined the group in 2019 after receiving his B.S. in Physics and Chemistry at U.C. Davis. A large portion of the LAMMPS information on this site is his contribution.
