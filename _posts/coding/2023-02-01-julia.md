Julia is a relatively new programming language that first appeared in 2012. It was originally developed by Jeff Bezanson, Stefan Karpinski, Viral B. Shah, and Alan Edelman. The name Julia has no special meaning, the developers thought it "just seemed like a pretty name."[^1] The tagline for the Julia language is "writes like Python, runs like C." The language aims to become the predominant language for scientific computing. In addition to its easy syntax and fast run speed, Julia is open-source and constantly improving. The pages in this section are dedicated to providing an additional resource to highlight some key features of the language.
