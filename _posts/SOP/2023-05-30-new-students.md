### Set Up Visual Studio Code

If you do any coding during your time in the Eaves Research Group--and chances are high that you will--you need an IDE (integrated development environment). The preferred IDE is Visual Studio Code developed by Microsoft. Installation of VS Code is straightforward, just [download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) the correct file for your system and follow the instructions. In addition to supporting most programming languages straight out of the box, VS Code is currently (2023) the official editor for Julia. See [this installation guide](https://www.julia-vscode.org/docs/dev/gettingstarted/) to prepare to use Julia in VS Code.

#### Extensions

VS Code works primarily by starting with a lightweight frame that allows you to build on the functionality that you need through extensions. While this feature makes it less specialized in any particular language, it makes it a fairly decent localized place to do all of your coding. Some useful extensions are

- GitLens -- Git supercharged: Adds useful version control information in your GitHub panel (source control CTRL-SHFT-G)
- Julia: Support for the Julia language. Includes formatting, syntax, and color coding.
- Julia Color Themes: Color themes for Julia (and Python!)
