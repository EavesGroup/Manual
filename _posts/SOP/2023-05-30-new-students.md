### Set Up Your IDE

If you do any coding during your time in the Eaves Research Group--and chances are high that you will--you need an IDE (integrated development environment). The preferred IDE is Visual Studio Code developed by Microsoft. Installation of VS Code is straightforward, just [download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) the correct file for your system and follow the instructions. In addition to supporting most programming languages straight out of the box, VS Code is currently (2023) the official editor for Julia. See [this installation guide](https://www.julia-vscode.org/docs/dev/gettingstarted/) to prepare to use Julia in VS Code.

#### Extensions

VS Code works primarily by starting with a lightweight frame that allows you to build on the functionality that you need through extensions. While this feature makes it less specialized in any particular language, it makes it a fairly decent localized place to do all of your coding. Some useful extensions are

- GitLens -- Git supercharged: Adds useful version control information in your GitHub panel (source control CTRL-SHIFT-G)
- Julia: Support for the Julia language. Includes formatting, syntax, and color coding.
- Julia Color Themes: Color themes for Julia (and Python!)

### GitHub

GitHub is an online code hosting platform, perfect for version control and sharing your work. Version control is the most important part of why you should use GitHub and some of the lingo and best practices surrounding that will be explained below. Our group does not often work on a code project synchronously, but being able to easily share your work with Joel or other inheritors of your work can be useful.

#### Push/Pull/Commit/Fork/Clone

These words form the core of the lingo that you will frequently use when working with GitHub. To build familiarity with the usage of these words, we will work through a useful example using the LAMMPS code repository.

Begin by creating/logging into your account on GitHub and navigating to the [LAMMPS code repository](https://github.com/lammps/lammps). We wish to use LAMMPS in a slightly edited form for our own research, so we will [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) the repository to our own account. During this process, you can give the forked repo a different name and you should change the description to something that is more reflective of your version.

Now that we have our own version of LAMMPS on GitHub, we need to copy the files to our local machine to install and run the program. It is also easier to make edits to any files on our local machine. This process of copying files is called [cloning](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository).
