During your time with the Eaves group, you will generate data and knowledge that needs to be stored somewhere safe and eventually published in a journal. These sections will detail how we in the Eaves group prefer to store this data, so that it can be easily handed over on request or used to reproduce results by future members.

In the summer of 2022, the University of Colorado Boulder transferred from unlimited Google Drive storage space for everyone to OneDrive space, with individual users getting 5 TB of storage.
