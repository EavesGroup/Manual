### A Guide to CURC (University of Colorado Boulder Research Computing)

The university maintains several high-performance computing (HPC) 'clusters'. These clusters form a system of many computing CPUs and, in some cases, GPUs. The cluster typically used and encountered by members of the group is called Alpine. The main stop for questions about CURC is the [documentation at readthedocs](https://curc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Some important pages include: [how to login](https://curc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/access/logging-in.html), a [description of the filesystem](https://curc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/compute/filesystems.html), and [how to run calculations](https://curc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/compute/filesystems.html). The manual pages linked below are to provide small tips and tricks specific to things our group does or things that are difficult to find/understand within the documentation.
