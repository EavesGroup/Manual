VASP, the Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Package, is a computer package used for modeling materials from first principles. The use of plane wave basis sets makes it ideal for solids and periodic structures. A lot of information regarding usage and installation can be found on the [wiki](https://www.vasp.at/wiki/index.php/The_VASP_Manual). The workshops and lectures found there provide an excellent overview of VASP as well. For a general overview of density functional theory (DFT) see the original Kohn-Sham paper[^1] and the review paper by Jones and Gunnarsson[^2].
