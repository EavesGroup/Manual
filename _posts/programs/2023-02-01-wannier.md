Wannier has a lot of useful resources outside of this manual. Peyton considers the 2012 review paper[^Wannier2012] by Marzari and Vanderbilt to be the best. However, the initial 1997[^Wannier1997] and 2001[^Wannier2001] papers can be a better source for the nitty-gritty details and definitions about isolated versus entangled bands. For completeness I also note that there is a 2008 paper.[^Wannier2008] The [Wannier90 site](http://www.wannier.org/support/) also has a user guide as well as tutorials and their solutions.
